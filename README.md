## Project Description

The **Tour-and-Travel-Website** project is a web-based application that aims to provide users with information and booking services for various tour and travel packages. The website is designed to be user-friendly and visually appealing, offering an intuitive interface for users to explore different destinations, view package details, and make bookings.

The key features of the project include:

- **Destination Listings**: The website provides a comprehensive listing of various travel destinations, including popular tourist spots, cities, and countries. Each destination includes detailed information such as descriptions, attractions, and images.

- **Package Details**: Users can browse through different tour packages offered by the website. Each package includes information about the itinerary, duration, cost, and included services.

- **User Authentication**: The website includes user authentication functionality, allowing users to create accounts, log in, and manage their bookings. Registered users can also view their booking history and update their profile information.

## Technologies Used

The **Tour-and-Travel-Website** project utilizes the following technologies:

- **Front-end**: The user interface is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It incorporates modern design principles and responsive layouts to ensure a seamless experience across different devices.

- **Back-end**: The server-side logic is implemented using a combination of technologies, including Node.js and Express.js. These frameworks provide a robust and scalable backend infrastructure for handling user requests, managing data, and implementing business logic.
